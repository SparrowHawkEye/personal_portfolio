        <h3>Journey to the Center of the World of WEB</h3>
        <p>
          I am learning Web Development from 2012. Just as a passion to learn.
          As I am from different faculty I need to keep pace with my study and
          with other surrounding difficulties. I have to soft coding. After 2020
          I again start to learn. In this time I gather all the things which i
          learn before and also improve myself. And now I can code but do not
          know how to make it aliveüíñ. Thats why I am here in Programing Hero
          ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. To be the Hero I want to be and to make my passion and dream true. ü§†

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working with Programming
            Hero. They always encourage us not to stop LEARNING, LEARNING and
            LEARNING!!

            I have master the 3 core Languages, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know
            everything needed to make a website function and efficient. Though I
            know much still i know nothing. The World of web is growing every

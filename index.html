        <p>
          They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web
          developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it.
          And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.

        <p>
          I have master the 3 core Languages, HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know
          everything needed to make a website function and efficient. I didn't
          stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript
          framework called React JS. I even know the deployment, server and
          security. I will give you 100% web solution. Though I know many still
          i know nothing. The World of web is growing every second, so I need to
          keep the pace with this growing World. Which i can do by LEARNING,
          LEARNING and LEARNING!!
